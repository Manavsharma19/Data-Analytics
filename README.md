This project analyzes the humanDetails.csv dataset to uncover patterns using **predictive models**.

Task 1: Predict income using Work-class and Age with a **Decision Tree Classifier**, cleaning data and identifying overfitting with cross-validation.

Task 2: Predict income using hours-per-week, Occupation, Age, and relationship with Decision Tree and **KNN classifiers**, filling missing data and visualizing accuracy comparisons.

Task 3: Apply **K-Means clustering** using age, fnlwgt, education-num, and hours-per-week, visualizing data based on income and cluster labels.

Each task includes **data cleaning**, **model training**, **visualization**, and result interpretation.
